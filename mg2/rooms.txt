Cavern
You enter a large cavern. You are surprised to find that the walls of the cave are glowing so you have no problem
seeing the large stalactites that have formed. To the south you hear the sound of rushing water. To the north you hear
strange sounds that sound like someone with a broken heart. You see as set of stairs at the west end of the cavern.

You have entered a dark twisting, tunnel that seems to wind around the Cavern. The low wailing you heard before has
risen to a screech that is making your hair stand on end. You see a sign that says "Proceed at your own risk. Anyone
entering this area will be eaten.
